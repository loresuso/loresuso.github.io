Welcome to my corner of the internet! 

I am Lorenzo Susini, a Threat Research Engineer currently working for Sysdig. Previously, I was an Open Source Software Engineer and mainly worked on Falco, a graduated CNCF runtime security tool. 

I have a passion for security, programming, and technology, and I enjoy writing about these topics.

Beyond my professional interests, I am passionate about music, sports, traveling, and nature.

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzosusini/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/loresuso).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss security, programming, or any of my interests!
